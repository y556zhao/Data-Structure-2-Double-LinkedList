# Doubly-LinkedList
Intro: Doubly Linked List is a way to implement the list ADT. Specifically, it is based on pointers and nodes, which the image below explains the basic mechanism. For each node, it contains three variables: a prev pointer, a next pointer, and a "data". Because of the double pointers feature, it allows you to move forward and backward through the list. Compared with the linked list, the insertion and the delete are much easier by using the Doubly Linked List. However, it is hard to directly access an element. 

Code: The main functions (or methods) include insert function, delete function, select function, and search function. Please refer to the hpp file for more details.
